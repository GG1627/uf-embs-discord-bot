For anyone who's in need of a camera, im giving out my Sony A7 iii camera with 18-105 f4 together. 
They both in original box and in nearly brand new condition. I purchased them in 2024 Christmas but didn't 
use it, only for some test shoots much and they stay in box after, I'm giving it out because I just got a 
drone and I thought of giving out the old one to someone who can't afford one and is in need of it...
Strictly first come first serve no partial...

Hello Besties,

I never thought I’d be in this situation, but life has taken an unexpected turn. I have 4 incredible seats for the upcoming Coldplay concert on Sunday, July 27, 2025, at 6:45 PM at Hard Rock Stadium Complex in Miami, Florida—offering a fantastic view of the stage, close enough to feel all the energy!

Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I won’t be able to attend. My sister was recently involved in a serious accident, and I need to travel to be by her side during her recovery. It’s a tough time for us, and I’m hoping to find someone who can enjoy this experience instead.

If you’re interested, please reach out to me privately. It would mean so much if these could go to someone who truly loves Coldplay as much as I do.

Thank you for reading and for any help you can offer. Your kindness means more than words can express.💖

Please DM me if you need them: +1 (572) 233-5204
